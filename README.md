# QR-Code-Scanner-App

Made a QR Code scanner function to be integrated with the main Alcheringa App. Alcheringa is the annual cultural fest of IIT Guwahati. I have used a very popular library known as ZXing to make this QR Code scanner. It is as API which enables us to convert the QR-Code picture into binary and extract weblinks from it.
